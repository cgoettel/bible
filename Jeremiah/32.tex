    \verse{32:36} Now, therefore, thus says the \textsc{Lord}, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you all say, ``It's been given to the king of Babylon by force, famine, and pestilence'':%%
    \verse{32:37} ``Listen to me! I am gathering them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, fury, and great wrath. I will bring them back home and let them live here.%%
    \verse{32:38} They have been\footnote{alt., proven themselves to be} my people so I will be their God.%%
    \verse{32:39} I have given them one heart and one way: to respect me all their lives~--- for their good and for the good of\footnote{Understood} their children.%%
    \verse{32:40} I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I won't withhold from doing good to them. I will instill my fear in their hearts so that they won't turn their backs on me.%%
    \verse{32:41} I rejoice over them when they do good. With all My heart and soul, I have planted them in this land of truth.''%%
