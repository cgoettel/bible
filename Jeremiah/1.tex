  \ed{The verb used here, \Hebrew{יָצַר}, is defined in \textsc{halot} as generally meaning ``\textbf{form}, \textbf{shape}.'' However, when the subject is God, it means ``\textbf{create}, \textbf{form}'' but is noted as being an ``older, concrete synonym of \textit{b\=ar\=a'}''; since Jeremiah comes so late in the Hebrew period, it is doubtful, from a language standpoint, that the Lord is talking about creating. Additionally, from a theological and biological standpoint, it would be inconsistent to say that the Lord created Jeremiah in his mother's womb. This could only work poetically, not literally.}%%
