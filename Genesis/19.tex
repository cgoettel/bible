  \verse{19:1} Two messengers\ca{prp \Hebrew{הָאֲנָשִׁים} cf 12.\thinspace16}{probably ``men,'' compare verses~12 and~16 [and 15]} came to Sodom in the evening as\lit{and} Lot was sitting at Sodom's gate. And Lot saw them and stood to greet them, and bowed down, his face to the ground.%%
  \verse{19:2} He said, ``My lords, please, please turn in to your servant's house: spend the night, wash your feet, get up early, and go on your way.'' But they said, ``No. We will spend the night in the open.''%%
  \verse{19:3} He urged them strongly, and they turned aside to him and came into his house. He prepared\lit{made} a feast for them, baked unleavened bread,\halot{xxxx}{for ordinary meals} and they ate.%%
  \verse{19:4} Before they lay down, the men\ed{Remember that ``men'' is the Hebrew mass noun for both men and women. It can technically just mean ``men,'' but I find it highly unlikely that such a sexually driven culture (cf.~v5) would solely consist of homosexuals.} of the city (the men of Sodom)\ca{frt gl}{perhaps glossed} from young to old~--- to the last man\lit{all the people from the edge}\halot{xxxx}{to the last man}~--- surrounded the house,%%
  \verse{19:5} and they called out to Lot and said to him, ``Where are the men that have come in to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them.''\ed{This is super messed up. Absolutely disgusting behavior.}%%
  \verse{19:6} Lot went out to them~--- to the entrance~--- closed the door behind himself%%
  \verse{19:7} and said, ``My brethren, please don't behave objectionably.\alt{do evilly}\ed{Bold talk coming from him.}%%
  \verse{19:8} I have two virgin\lit{who have not had sex with a man} daughters. Please let me bring them out to you and you can do whatever you want to them;\lit{do with them what is good in your eyes} just\alt{only} don't do anything to these men because\lit{for therefore} they've come under the shadow of my house.''\ed{Unarguably more messed up.}%%
  \verse{19:9} They said, ``Stand back!''\alt{Get away!} And they said,\ca{\missing\ \septuagint}{missing in the Septuagint} ``This one has come to stay, and he totally judges us!\understood\ Now, we will do evilly more so with you than with them!'' They strongly urged the man~--- Lot~--- and they drew near to break down the door.%%
  \verse{19:10} The men reached out\lit{stretched out their hands} and brought Lot into the house, to them, and closed the door.%%
  \verse{19:11} The men who were at the door of the house~--- from smallest to largest~--- were smitten with a dazzling light\ed{Other editions give ``blindness''} and they gave up\alt{got tired} looking for the door.%%
  \verse{19:12} The men said to Lot, ``Who else is here? A son-in-law,\alt{brother-in-law; although this doesn't make much contextual sense, especially given verse~14.} your sons, your daughters, and everyone you have in the city~--- bring them out of this\understood\ca{\sampen\septuagint\peshitta\ + \Hebrew{הזה} ut 13\thinspace.\thinspace14}{the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, and Peshitta all add ``this,'' as also in verses~13 and~14.} place%%

  \verse{19:14} Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law (those who had married his daughters), and said, ``Get up and get out of this place because the \lord\ is going to destroy the city.'' But, in his sons-in-laws' view, he was joking around.\ed{Both Lot and his daughters made a great decision with these guys.}%%
  \verse{19:15} When the morning had broken,\lit{the dawn had ascended} the messengers\ca{prp \Hebrew{האנשׁים} cf 1\super{a--a}}{probably ``the men,'' compare verse~1} urged Lot, saying, ``Get up. Take your wife and your two daughters who are present lest you're all\understood\ swept away in the city's sin.''%%
  \verse{19:16} Lot lingered\ed{There is an incredibly rare cantillation mark used here (\Hebrew{וַֽיִּתְמַ֯הְמָ֓הּ}) called a Shalshelet (\thinspace\Hebrew{֓}\thinspace) that is said to represent a hesitation or a struggle with one's inner demons. In this case, it is said to mean that Lot is uncertain about leaving Sodom. I don't give too much credit to cantillation marks, but it's an interesting thought nonetheless.} and the men took him and his wife and his daughters by the hand, the \lord\ sparing\halot{xxxx}{\textbf{sparing}, forbearance \haref{Gn}{19}{16}, compassion \haref{Is}{63}{9}. $\dagger$} him; and they led him out and put him outside the city.%%
  \verse{19:17} When they'd brought them out, he\ca{\septuagint\peshitta\vulgate\ pl}{The Septuagint, Peshitta, and Vulgate have this in plural}\ed{\textsc{lsg} gives ``l'un d'eux,'' meaning ``one of them''} said, ``Get to safety!\lit{Escape for your life!}\halot{xxxx}{\textbf{get oneself to safety} \haref{Gn}{19}{17}} Don't look\alt{glance} behind you. Don't stand in any\lit{all} of the plain or the mountain lest you're snatched away.''%%
  \verse{19:18} Lot said to them, ``Please, not so, my Lord!\ca{prp \Hebrew{–ִי}}{it's been proposed that it's \Hebrew{–ִי} [see further in Appendix~\ref{app:adonai}]}%%
  \verse{19:19} Your servant has found favor in your eyes and you've made your loving-kindness great to me by keeping me alive,\alt{saving my life} but I can't escape to the mountain lest evil fastens itself to me and I die.%%
  \verse{19:20} Please, this city is close to fleeing\alt{escaping, slipping away} here and it's insignificant.\alt{trifling} Please let me flee to there~--- is that insignificant?~--- and I will live.''\lit{my life will live.}%%
  \verse{19:21} He\ed{One of them? The Lord?} said to him, ``I've also accepted your face for this thing\ed{What?} to not destroy the city that you've talked about.%%
  \verse{19:22} Hurry and escape from here because I can't do anything until you come here.'' That's why\lit{Therefore} the city is named Zoar.\ed{Means ``small'' or ``insignificant.''}%%
  \verse{19:23} The sun rose on the earth and Lot came into Zoar.%%
  \verse{19:24} \ca{frt tr huc 26}{Perhaps transpose verse~26 here [meaning that Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt before the Lord destroyed the city]}The \lord\ caused sulfur and fire to rain down on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the \lord\ from Heaven,\ca{add?}{added [later]?}%%
  \verse{19:25} and He destroyed\alt{overthrew} these cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and the growth\alt{what had sprouted} from the ground.%%
  \verse{19:26} His wife looked behind herself and she became a pillar of salt.%%
  \verse{19:27} Abraham got up early in the morning [and went]\ca{ins \Hebrew{וַיֵּלֶךְ}?}{insert ``and went?''}\ed{I used the same syntax that the \textsc{darby} uses because, even though I'm against making this an eclectic edition, I feel that the verse requires this possibly missing section.} to the place where he'd stood before the\lit{face of the} \lord.%%
  \verse{19:28} He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the\lit{face of the} plains\lit{land of the plains}\ca{pc Mss \sampen\septuagint\super{C\thinspace a\thinspace l}\peshitta\targum\super{Ms} invers, sic l et dl c Ms \Hebrew{ארץ}?}{a few manuscripts, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Septuagint, Peshitta, and Targum (in inverse order), thus read and delete when the manuscript says ``land''?} and saw a smoke on the land going up like the smoke of a furnace.\alt{forge.}%%
  
  \verse{19:29} God destroyed the cities of the plain, and God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction, when He destroyed the cities that Lot lived in.%%
  \verse{19:30} Lot went up to Zoar and lived in the mountain, his two daughters with him, because he was afraid to live in Zoar.\ed{Why?} So he and his two daughters\ca{\sampen\septuagint\vulgate\super{Mss}\ + \Hebrew{עִמּוֺ}}{The Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, and manuscripts of the Vulgate add ``with him.''} lived in a cave.%%
  \verse{19:31} The eldest\ed{Interesting that she was unmarried.} said to the youngest,\alt{younger} ``Our father is old and there isn't a man in the world to come into us\ed{Does this work idiomatically the same as it does in modern English?} as is the custom in the whole world.%%
  \verse{19:32} Let's go and give Dad\lit{our dad} wine to drink and lie down with him so that we can preserve our father's posterity.''%%
  \verse{19:33} That night, they gave their dad wine to drink, and the eldest went in and she lay with her father; and he didn't know that she'd lied down or gotten up.\lit{and he didn't know in her lying down or her getting up.}%%
  \verse{19:34} On the next day, the eldest said to the youngest, ``I lay with my\ca{\septuagint\ suff 1 pl, l \Hebrew{אבינוּ}?}{The Septuagint pronominal suffix is first person plural [our], read ``our father?''} father last night.\alt{yesterday evening} Let us again\lit{also} give him wine to drink tonight, and you go in and lie with him so that we can preserve our father's posterity.''%%
  \verse{19:35} So again gave their father wine to drink that night, and the youngest got up and lay with him; and he didn't know that she'd lied down or gotten up.%%
  \verse{19:36} Both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.%%
  \verse{19:37} The oldest gave birth to a son and named him Moab (he's the forefather of the present-day Moabites\lit{the Moabites to this day}).%%
  \verse{19:38} The youngest also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-ammi (he's the forefather of the present-day Beni-ammon\alt{children of Ammon}).%%
