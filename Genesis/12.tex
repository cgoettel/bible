  \verse{12:3} I will bless those who bless you and curse those that curse you.\lit{and those that curse you I will curse.} In you\ie{Because of you, Through you} shall all of the families of the earth be blessed.''%%

  \verse{12:8} He moved on from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched\lit{stretched out} his tent with Bethel to the west and Ai\alt{Hai} to the east. He built an altar there to the \textsc{Lord} and called on the name of \textsc{God}.%%

  \verse{12:12} When the Egyptians see you, they will say, `This is\understood\ his wife,' and they will kill me and keep you alive.%%

  \verse{12:15} Pharaoh's princes saw her and praised her to Pharaoh and took the woman to Pharaoh's house.\ed{This is a strong argument for Abraham's seemingly unethical behavior in having his wife lie and say that she's his sister: the Egyptian princes see her and immediately take her (kidnap?) to Pharaoh.

  \verse{12:20} Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him,\ed{Abram} and sent him and his wife and all that they had away.%%
