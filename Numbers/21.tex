  \verse{21:5} The people spoke to God and to Moses: ``Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in the desert? Because there is no bread or water, our souls abhor this worthless food.''%%
  \verse{21:6} So the \lord\ sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people. And many of the people of Israel died.%%
  \verse{21:7} The people came in to Moses and they said, ``We have sinned because we have spoken against the \lord\ and against you. Pray to the \lord\ that he take the serpents away from us.'' So Moses prayed on behalf of the people.%%
  \verse{21:8} The \lord\ said to Moses, ``Make a fiery serpent for yourself and place it on a pole.\halot{xxxx}{xxxx} And it shall be that everyone that is bitten, when he looks at it he shall live.''%%

  \noindent\verse{21:16} From there\ed{understood: they journeyed} to Beer, it is the well that the \lord\ spoke to Moses: ``Gather the people and I will give them water.''%%
  
  \verse{21:17} Israel then sang this song:\smallskip%%

  \verse{21:23} Sihon wouldn't allow Israel to pass through his border; Sihon gathered all his people and went out against\ed{It's easy to mistake this verse as saying ``Sihon gathered all his people and went out to meet Israel,'' but \Hebrew{קרא} has two meanings: \begin{inparaenum}\item to \textbf{call}, \textbf{name}, or \textbf{summon}, and \item (to go to battle) \textbf{against}.\end{inparaenum}} Israel in the desert.
