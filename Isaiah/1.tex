:``Ah, now I will be relieved\footnote{eased} of mine adversaries: I am avenged of mine enemies.%%
  \verse{1:25} Lest I turn my hand on thee\footnote{I will turn my hand back on thee}%%

:I will purify thine dross~--- I will turn aside all thine tin.\footnote{Tin \emph{is} useful. It is used to make brass (a copper and tin alloy). One of the symbolisms here is that although tin is useful, the Lord has a greater plan in mind for each of us. Therefore, we need to listen to Him and do as He commands although we may think that what we are doing in lieu of obeying is important and useful.}%%
  \verse{1:26} I will restore\footnote{return} thine judges as at first And thy counselors as in the beginning.%%

:After this though shalt be called \textit{A City of Righteousness: A Faithful City}.%%

:They shall burn together: None shall quench them.''%%
