  \verse{6:1} In the year King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne, His flowing skirt filled the temple.%%
  \verse{6:2} Seraphs stood right above Him. Each had six wings: they each covered their faces with two, their feet with two, and with two they flew.%%
  \verse{6:3} They proclaimed to each other, and said,\smallskip%%
  
  \pc ``Holy, holy, holy is the \textsc{Lord} of Hosts.\pa The whole earth is full of His glory.''\smallskip%%
  
  \noindent\verse{6:4} The threshold's foundations moved about at the sound of the crier; the house was filled with smoke.%%
  \verse{6:5} I said:\smallskip%%
  
  \pc ``Woe is me because I am undone\pa on account that I'm a man of unclean lips;%%
  
  \pc because I live among people with unclean lips;%%
  
  \pc because my eyes have seen the King, the \textsc{Lord} of Hosts.''\smallskip%%
  
  \noindent\verse{6:6} One of the seraphs flew to me. In his hand he had a glowing coal which he'd taken from the altar with tongs.%%
  \verse{6:7} He touched me on my mouth,%
  \lit{He caused it to touch my lip}
  \ed{understood: with it}
  and said,\smallskip%%
  
  \pc ``This has indeed touched your lips:\pa your guilt is taken away, your sins expiated.%
  \ed{\Hebrew{רָז}, from Persian and attested in Aramaic, is equivalent to the Hebrew \Hebrew{סוֺד}, originally meaning ``a divine council,'' ``a council in Heaven,'' or ``the decision of a divine council.'' The Latin came to mean ``secret'' because the decision of the divine council was a secret, cf.\ \vref{Amos}{3}{7}.}%%
  
  \pa \verse{6:8} I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,\pa ``Whom shall I send?\pa Who shall go for us?''%%
  
  \pa And I said, ``I'm here.%
  \ed{In Abraham's time this could simply be rendered as ``Yes.''}
  Send me.''\pa \verse{6:9} And He said,\pa ``Go. You shall say to this people:%%
  
  \pc `Pay strict attention, yet you don't understand.\pa Watch very carefully, yet you don't know.'\ed{given in the prophetic perfect tense}%%
  
  \pb \verse{6:10} Fatten the heart of this people,\pa make their ears heavy, blind their eyes,\ed{with pitch}%%
  
  \pc lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears,\pa their hearts%
  \ed{It's wonderful how this language exemplifies that they're united in their rebellion against the Lord.}
  consider, and they repent and be healed.''\lit{they turn back and there is a healing for them.''}%%
  
  \pa \verse{6:11} And I said,\pa ``How long, Lord?''\pa and He said,%%
  
  \pc ``Until the cities\pa are desolated without inhabitant.\ed{This is literally ``Until wasted / cities without inhabitant.'' It had to be reshuffled so it was idiomatic with SVO~English.}%%
  
  \pc Until\ed{repeated} houses are without men\pa and the ground becomes a desolation.%%
  
  \pb \verse{6:12} Until\ed{repeated} the \textsc{Lord} has distanced man,\pa and the forsakeness is great in the midst\lit{heart} of the land.%%
  
  \pb \verse{6:13} And yet a tenth\pa shall repent\ie{a remnant shall return} and shall be burned%%
  
  \pc as the terebinth%
  \ed{a small tree that used to be a source of turpentine}
  and the oak\pa which%
