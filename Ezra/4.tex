    \verse{4:3} Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the chief fathers of Israel said to them, ``It's not for you, but for us, to build a house to our God, because only we\alt{we alone} shall build to the \textsc{Lord} God of Israel, as was commanded by King Cyrus, king of Persia.''%%
    \verse{4:4} And so the people of the land discouraged\alt{demoralized} the \lit{the hands of the}people of Judah and terrified\alt{made them be out of their senses} them in building.%%
    \verse{4:5} They bribed counselors against them to frustrate\alt{put an end to, invalidate} their plans\alt{schemes} throughout the days of Cyrus, king of Persia, until the reign of Darius, king of Persia.%%
    \verse{4:6} During the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation\ed{Interestingly, from \Hebrew{שׂטן} (satan), to accuse. However, this verse contains no such theological implications.} against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.%%

    \verse{4:11} Here is a copy of the letter which they sent to Artaxerxes the king, the servants, the men on this side of the river, and so on:%%
    
    \verse{4:12} ``Let it be known to the king that the Jews that have come up from you to us have gone into Jerusalem. They're building the rebellious and evil city\ed{The Aramaic word here, \Hebrew{קִרְיָה}, refers specifically to Jerusalem.} and are finishing the walls and laying\halot{xxxx}{The form, etymology, and meaning of \Hebrew{חוט} are uncertain; suggested ``repair,'' or ``lay,'' or ``inspect.''} the foundations.%%
    \verse{4:13} Let it be known to the king that if this city is built and its walls completed, they will not give tax, toll, or custom. Eventually,\halot{xxxx}{either ``treasury'' or as an adverb meaning ``eventually'' or ``positively.''} it will injure\alt{wrong} the king.%%

    \verse{4:15} so that someone can investigate in the book of the minutes\alt{memorandum} of your fathers.

Hence why this city was destroyed.\alt{devastated}%%
    \verse{4:16} We make it known to the king that if this city is built and its walls finished, because of this you will have no portion on this side of the river.''%%
    
    \verse{4:17} The king sent a decree to Rehum the chief commander\alt{of report(ing)} and to Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions who live in Samaria and the rest of the people\understood\ on the other side of the river: ``Peace and so on.%%
