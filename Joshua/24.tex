    \verse{24:13} I've given you the land that you didn't exert yourself for and cities you didn't build, and you live in them: vineyards and olive orchards that you didn't plant, and you eat them.\understood%%
    \verse{24:14} And now, fear the \textsc{Lord} and serve Him in honesty\alt{sincerity} and truth, and turn away from the gods whom your fathers served in the trans-Euphrates and Egypt, and serve the \textsc{Lord}.%%
