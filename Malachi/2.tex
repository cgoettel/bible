\ed{It's difficult to say if this chapter is literal or figurative. However, it's always best to assume that it's symbolic and find the meaning there, and then to figure out if it's literal. If this is purely symbolic, Israel is being called to repentance for forsaking the Lord in their youth and serving other gods. If this is literal, Israelites dealt unfaithfully with their covenant wives, divorced them, and married foreign women. Either way, the message is of faithfulness to spouse and God.}
\ed{In ancient Israel there are three elements of marriage: contract, consummation, and celebration. The contract is between the parents of the prospective groom and the prospective bride. Getting out of an engagement could be a very sticky affair. This was tradition from the period before Moses and continued through the end of the monarchic period. See further in Appendix~\ref{app:covenants-in-antiquity}.}
