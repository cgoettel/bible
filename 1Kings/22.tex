  \verse{22:6} The king of Israel assembled the prophets\ed{probably pagan prophets} (about 400~men\lit{400~in number}) and said to them, ``Should I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or should I leave it alone?''\alt{forbear, discontinue, stop?} They said to him, ``Go up and the Lord\ca{\fragheb\ mlt Mss \tetragrammaton}{multiple manuscripts in the Cairo Genizah have the Tetragrammaton} will give it into the hand of the king.''%%
  \verse{22:7} Jehoshaphat said, ``Is there not still\ca{\missing\ \septuagint*}{missing in the Septuagint (textus Graecus originalis) [makes more sense this way]} a prophet of the \textsc{Lord} here that we might inquire of\alt{seek} him?''\ed{Jehoshaphat here specifies that he specifically wants to ask a prophet of the Lord.}%%

  \verse{22:9} The king of Israel called to one court official,\halot{xxxx}{(eunuch who is a) \textbf{court official}} and said, ``Quickly! Micaiah son of Imlah.''%%

  \verse{22:14} Micaiah said, ``As the \textsc{Lord} lives, whatever the \textsc{Lord} says to me, that will I say.''\ed{Micaiah here shows the proper relationship that man is to have with God. We are not to ask the Lord to conform to what we want, but rather to be humble and be willing to do whatever he asks, even if it's against our will or to our own harm.}%%
  \verse{22:15} He came in to the king, and the king said to him, ``Micaiah, should we\ca{\septuagint\targum\super{f} sg}{singular in the Septuagint and Targum (codex Reuchlinianus (qui Olim \targum\super{L} dicebatur) secundum apparatum criticum Sperberi)} go down to Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or should we\ca{pc Mss \septuagint\targum\super{f} sg}{singular in a few manuscripts of the same} leave it alone?''

  \verse{22:22} He said, `I will go and be a lying\alt{deceptive} spirit in the mouth of all of the prophets.' So He said, `You shall persuade him\understood\ and you shall also be successful. Go out and do so.'%%
  \verse{22:23} And now, the \textsc{Lord} has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all of your prophets and the \textsc{Lord} has spoken evil concerning you.''%%
