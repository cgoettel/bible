\heading{7}{Gideon brings the Israelites to the River Jordan~--- through revelation, Gideon dismisses men until only three hundred remain~--- they surround the Midianite camp, wreak havoc, and are miraculously protected through combat}

    \verse{7:1} Jerubbaal (formerly\lit{who is} Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early. They set up\alt{pitched} a military camp by Harod's well. The Midianite camp was on the north in the valley by the hill Moreh.%%
    \verse{7:2} And the \textsc{Lord} said unto Gideon, ``The people with thee are too great\alt{many} for me to just give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, `My own hand hath saved me!'%%
    \verse{7:3} Now, please proclaim within earshot of the people, saying, `Whosoever is fearful and trembling, let him turn back and leave early from Mount Gilead.'\thinspace'' And 22\thinspace000 of the people turned back, and 10\thinspace000 remained.%%
    
    \verse{7:4} And the \textsc{Lord} saith unto Gideon, ``Still, the people are too many. Bring them down to the water and I shall refine\alt{test} them for you there. It shall be that he to whom I say to thee, `This man shall go with you,' shall go with you; and any that I say unto you, `This man shall not go,' shall not go.''%%
    \verse{7:5} So he brought the people down to the water.%%
    
    And the \textsc{Lord} said unto Gideon, ``Any who laps water with his tongue (like a dog), you shall set by himself. Likewise with those that kneel down to drink.''%%
    \verse{7:6} The number of those who lapped~--- putting their hands to their mouth~--- was 300 men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.%%
    
    \verse{7:7} And the \textsc{Lord} saith unto Gideon, ``I will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped; and I will give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the rest go unto their homes.''%%
    \verse{7:8} They took the people's provisions\ed{\Hebrew{צֵדָה}, from the root \Hebrew{צוד}, is not attested in \textsc{halot}. However, Davidson includes a Hithpael rendering which can mean ``to furnish oneself with provision'' (641) from which we can ascertain the root to have something to do with provisions. \textsc{ylt} renders it as ``provision'' and \textsc{darby} renders it as ``victuals'' so this seems to be verified.} and trumpets into their hands. And he sent every male Israelite away, every man to his tent; but he held onto the three hundred men. The Midianites' camp was in the valley below him.%%
    
    \verse{7:9} That night, the \textsc{Lord} said to him, ``Get up. Go down into the camp because I have delivered the camp into your hand.%%
    \verse{7:10} But if you're afraid to go down, then go down~--- you and your servant Phurah~--- to the camp%%
    \verse{7:11} and hear what they have to say.\lit{what they say} Afterwards, your hands shall be strengthened and you shall go down to the camp.'' So he went down with his servant, Phurah,\ed{xxxx: If he has more than one servant, remove commas.} to the border of the fifty men who were in the camp.%%
    \verse{7:12} And Midian and Amalek and all the Easterners\lit{children of the east} were lying in the valley like a swarm\alt{multitude} of locusts. Their camels are beyond number,\lit{to their camels there is no number} as multitudinous as the sand on the seashore.%%
    \verse{7:13} Gideon came and, look, a man was telling his friend about a dream; he said, ``I've had\lit{dreamed} a dream: a round loaf of barley bread was turning this way and that in the Midianites' camp, and it entered the tent, smote it, and the tent\understood\ fell and was turned upside down. The tent had fallen.''%%
    \verse{7:14} His friend replied and said, ``This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, an Israelite. God put Midian and the entire camp in his hand.''%%
    
    \verse{7:15} When Gideon had heard the dream being told\lit{the telling of the dream} as well as its interpretation, he bowed down and returned to the Israelites' camp and said, ``Get up because the \textsc{Lord} has given you\lit{placed in your hands} the Midianites' camp.''%%
    \verse{7:16} He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and gave everyone a trumpet,\lit{gave a trumpet into the hand of everyone} an empty jar,\alt{pitcher}\halot{xxxx}{large (pottery) jar for flour or water} and a torch to put in it.%%
    \verse{7:17} He said to them, ``Watch me and do what I do.\lit{thus do ye} I will come to the edge of the camp, and when I've done that, do the same.%%
    \verse{7:18} When we\ed{conjugated 1cs, but understood 1cp} blow the trumpet, me and everyone who's with me, blow your trumpets as well all around the camp and say, `For the \textsc{Lord} and for Gideon.'\thinspace''%%
    
    \verse{7:19} Gideon and his hundred\lit{the hundred men who were with him} came to the edge of the camp and got there at the beginning of the middle watch;\ed{\textsc{halot} notes this as being ``evidently the last watch of the night.'' However, since it is modified by \Hebrew{הַתִיכוֺנָה} (middle) it refers to the middle watch. This watch runs from 10~\textsc{pm} till 2~\textsc{am}.} however, the guards just took their station.\lit{however, it confirmed confirmed [verily/just confirmed] the guards.} They blew their trumpets and smashed the jars in their hands.%%
    \verse{7:20} The three companies blew their trumpets and smashed the jars. With the lamp in their left hand and the trumpets blowing in their right, they cried out, ``The sword of the \textsc{Lord} and of Gideon.''%%
    \verse{7:21} The men stood in their places surrounding the camp, the entire camp running, shouted in alarm, fleeing.%%
    \verse{7:22} The three hundred blew their\lit{the} trumpets and the \textsc{Lord} set every man's sword against his friend throughout the entire camp. And the camp fled to Beth-shittah towards Zererah, to the border of Abel-meholah towards Tabbath.%%
    \verse{7:23} Israelites were called\alt{summoned} from Naphtali, Asher, and from all of Manasseh to pursue the Midianites.%%
    \verse{7:24} Gideon sent messengers to the mountains\lit{all the mountains (alt., mountain range)} of Ephraim, saying, ``Come here to meet Midian. Capture them at the waters by Beth-barah and the Jordan River.'' The Ephraimites were summoned and they captured the waters from Beth-barah to the River Jordan.%%
    \verse{7:25} They captured two Midianite officials, Oreb and Zeeb. They slew Oreb at the Oreb Boulder, they slew Zeeb at the Zeeb Wine-vat, and they pursued the Midianites. They brought Oreb's and Zeeb's heads to Gideon to the opposite bank of the Jordan River.%%
