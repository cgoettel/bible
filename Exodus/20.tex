  \verse{20:1} And God spake all these words unto them, saying,%%
  
  \verse{20:2} \textsc{Preface.} ``I am the \textsc{Lord} your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of captivity.\alt{servitude, bondage, slavery.}%%
  \verse{20:3} \textsc{i.}\ed{There are varied approaches to numbering the commandments. The Philonic tradition is used here.} Don't have other gods besides me.\ed{There is no \textit{sof pasuq} (\Hebrew{׃}) in the \textsc{bhs}. This could be used as an argument in favor of the Philonic tradition.}%%
  \verse{20:4} \textsc{ii.} Don't make graven images\alt{idols} for yourselves, neither any image that is in the heavens above, nor in the earth, nor beneath the earth, nor in the waters beneath the earth.%%
  \verse{20:5} Don't bow down to them, neither shalt thou worship them: for I, the \textsc{Lord} your God, am a jealous God and will seek retribution unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me,%%
  \verse{20:6} but showing kindness\alt{keeping my covenant} to those who love me\lit{my lovers} and to those who keep my commandments.%%
  
  \verse{20:7} \textsc{iii.} Don't use\alt{take, lift up} the name of the \textsc{Lord} thy God with vain intent\alt{in vain, with vanity, to/with no good purpose} for the \textsc{Lord} will not hold him innocent\alt{guiltless} who uses His name with vain intent.\ed{The real meaning here is to not take an oath in the name of God and not intend to keep it.}%%
  
  \verse{20:8} \textsc{iv.} Remember the Sabbath day to sanctify it.\alt{consecrate, make it holy}\ed{The notion of \emph{making} the Sabbath day holy is more powerful than merely \emph{keeping} it holy for the responsibility then rests upon us to be an holy nation.}%%
  \verse{20:9} You shall labor and do all your work for six days;%%
  \verse{20:10} but the seventh day, the Sabbath of the \textsc{Lord} thy God, don't do any work: neither thee, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy male or female servant,\lit{nor his/your manservant, nor his/your maidservant} nor thy beast, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:%%
  \verse{20:11} for it took six days for the \textsc{Lord} to make the heavens and the earth and all that is upon the face thereof, and on the seventh day he rested. Therefore, the \textsc{Lord} blessed the Sabbath day and consecrated it.%%
  
  \verse{20:12} \textsc{v.} Take thy father and thy mother seriously so that thy days may be lengthened upon the land the \textsc{Lord} thy God giveth\ed{Referring to the Promised Land that they have yet to inherit. It is in the participle form showing an ongoing action.} thee.%%
  
  \verse{20:13} \textsc{vi.} Don't murder.\ed{It is not ``kill.'' The root that appears in the \textsc{bhs} (\Hebrew{רצח}) has behind it the idea of malicious forethought.}%%
  
  \verse{20:14} \textsc{vii.} Don't commit adultery.%%
  
  \verse{20:15} \textsc{viii.} Don't steal.%%
  
  \verse{20:16} \textsc{ix.} Don't answer falsely.\alt{bear false witness/testimony.}%%
  
  \verse{20:17} \textsc{x.} Don't desire\alt{covet} thy neighbor's house, neither shall you desire your neighbor's wife, nor his male or female servant, nor his ox, nor his male donkey, nor anything that is thy neighbors.''%%
  
  \verse{20:18} Then all the people were witnesses to the thunder,\lit{His voice} lightning, the sound of the trumpet, and the smoke of the mount. And they were witnesses and removed themselves.\ed{In other words, they recognized the power and glory of God and stood back so as to not be consumed by His almighty power.}%%
  \verse{20:19} They then said to Moses, ``Speak on our behalf that we hear, and let Him not speak with us lest we die.''%%
  \verse{20:20} So Moses said unto the people, ``Don't be afraid, because in order to test thee, God is coming; and in order that thy reverence for Him be before you, that you don't sin.''%%
  \verse{20:21} The people stood back as Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.%%
  
  \verse{20:22} The \textsc{Lord} said to Moses, ``Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel: `You have seen that I have spoken with you from the heavens.%%
  \verse{20:23} don't make of me gods of gold or silver for yourselves.%%
  \verse{20:24} Thou shalt make for me an altar of earth and shalt offer unto me a burnt offering and a peace offering.%%
  \verse{20:25} But if you make an altar of stones to me, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones\ed{lest it's confused with an idol or graven image} nor\lit{don't} fashion those stones with tools: if thou wieldest thine tool\ie{a metal instrument or tool. Not really a sword, although that is the word used in the \textsc{bhs}.} and lay it upon it\ie{the altar} thou wilt defile it.%%
  \verse{20:26} Thou shalt not ascend on the steps to my altar in order that thy nakedness be not revealed on this altar.'\thinspace''%%
