    \verse{21:24} an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot,\ed{This is significantly more merciful than people let on. In other ancient civilizations (e.g., Hammurabi's code) there were different punishments depending on the person's social status. This is a step towards equality.}%%
